# -Olken-s-csv-dataset-model
Two weeks ago we looked at Olken’s dataset, which showed that a random audit experiment did not reduce the amount of missing funds (a measure of corruption). A friend who hasn’t taken PS 6800 comes to you with an observational dataset that they claim shows that audits do reduce corruption in a different case (let’s say Argentina)
